        <p class="spacing-m">Thinfilm is a San Jose-based company, whose value proposition is to enhance the customer experience with non-electronic items by adding unique near field communication tags, or <a class="a-active" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/137979/htg-explains-what-is-nfc-and-what-can-i-use-it-for/" target="_blank">NFC tags</a>, providing both the customer and the seller with valuable contextual actionable information. In spite of this, their initial presentation proposal used kitchen appliances, which seemed to downplay the presentation impact. We assumed users would already expect these appliances to have a level of connectivity.</p>

          <figcaption class="spacing-m">Initial screens provided by Thinfilm</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>To give Thinfilm’s presentation the surprise effect we wanted, we brainstormed items that would replace these appliances by fulfilling some requirements:</p>
        <ol class="bullets">
          <li>does not have any electronic parts and internet connectivity,</li>
          <li>consumers are emotionally related to, and</li>
          <li>is of everyday use.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="spacing-s">After a series of ideas, we came up with a fictional protein powder brand called MuscleUp, around which we tailored the narrative.</p>
        <img class="spacing-s" src="images/sapcx/jars.png" alt="MuscleUp jars">
        <p class="spacing-m">We defined the user journey based on current and future-facing capabilities of Thinfilm’s NFC technology. The whole experience would happen on a mobile device, and the prototype would account for multiple use cases.</p>
